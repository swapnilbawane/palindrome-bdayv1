outerobject.innerobject[keyInsideInnerObject] will give you value of keyInsideInnerObject. 

so for example 
a { 
    
b 
{c:4}
    
}; 

so to access 4 we need to write a.b.c; if we know c. 
But in most programs c will come from another place so it will be a variable that accepts it during runtime. 
in that case we should write a.b[variablename]; 
here [] informs the execution that the value has to come and has not come yet. 

if variablename is not used it will be undefined. 

object is a declaration. We are declaring data type. So we add semicolon at the end of it. 

let and var does not define data type. 

Data Coercion when you assign data to any variable. 

let a; will return typeof undefined because no data type is associated with it. 

but let a = 5; will return number as data type for a;
